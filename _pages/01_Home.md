*I'm an inquisitive individual who aspires to become a part of a research environment that explores how our brains can inspire machines, in terms of learning, reasoning, vision, and motor planning. Also, I am passionate about improving technologies that enable us to probe complex brain structures and functions, build advanced neural prostheses, and delineate the neurodegenerative disease mechanisms.*

I am currently working as a Junior Lecturer at the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering ([ENTC](ent.mrt.ac.lk)) at University of Moratuwa [UoM](http://mrt.ac.lk), Sri Lanka. 

I received my Bachelor's degree from UoM in 2020. I completed my thesis on "Designing a Cost-Effective Dry Contact sEMG Sensor System for Controlling a Bionic Hand" with Dr. [Simon Kappel](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/simon-lind-kappel(ac38d32d-9622-4bf6-9103-1d9225c5322c).html) and Dr. [Thilina Lalitharatne](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0NvOK1kAAAAJ&hl=en)

In addition to my undergraduate studies, I have completed two research internships (in 2017 and 2018) focused on modelling genetic epilepsy based on the high density multi-electrode array (MEA) signals extracted from in-vitro neuronal networks, under the supervision of Prof. [Steve Petrou](https://www.florey.edu.au/science-research/scientist-directory/professor-steven-petrou) and Prof. [Saman Halgamuge](https://mechanical.eng.unimelb.edu.au/people/saman) at The Florey Institute of Neuroscience, University of Melbourne, Australia.

My primary academic interests lie within **Machine Learning** and **Signal Processing**, together with their applications in **Computational Neuroscience, Neuroengineering** and **Medical Imaging**. I am fascinated by work that attempts to bridge the gap between the human brain and machines, especially in terms of learning, memory, reasoning, vision, and motor planning. Also, I am keen to develop computer vision and signal processing methods to advance the field of biomedical imaging. Moreover, I have become interested in research that applies computational methods to model neurodegenerative diseases. 

Reecently, I have adopted a keen interest in the theroetical aspects of **Statistical Signal Processing, Geometric Deep Learning** and **Computer Vision**.

During my time at UoM, I worked with **Digital System Design, Analog Electronics** and **Robotics** as well.

In my free time, I like playing the piano, exploring restaurants (especially pizzerias!), and watching Star Wars!
