I am currently working as a Temporary Instructor at the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering ([ENTC](ent.mrt.ac.lk)) at the [University of Moratuwa](http://mrt.ac.lk), Sri Lanka.


In addition to my undergraduate studies, I have completed two research internships (in 2017 and 2018) under the supervision of Prof. [Steve Petrou](https://www.florey.edu.au/science-research/scientist-directory/professor-steven-petrou) and Prof. [Saman Halgamuge](https://mechanical.eng.unimelb.edu.au/people/saman) at The Florey Institute of Neuroscience, University of Melbourne, Australia.


My academic interests lie within **Machine Learning, Information Theory, Learning Theory, Computational Neuroscience, Brain/Muscle-Computer Interfaces** and **NMR Imaging**. I have also worked with **Digital Signal Processing, Digital System Design, Analog Electronics** and **Robotics** during my time at Moratuwa.
