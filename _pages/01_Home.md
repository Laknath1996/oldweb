*I aspire to explore how our brains can inspire machine intelligence. To this end, I work on an intersection between machine learning, signal processing, and computational neuroscience. My other research interests includes computer vision, biomedical data science, and neuromorphic computing.*

I would be joining Prof. Joshua Vogeltein's research group ([NeuroData](https://neurodata.io/about/)) at the Johns Hopkins University to pursue my PhD in the Fall of 2021. I am currently working as a Junior Lecturer at the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering ([ENTC](ent.mrt.ac.lk)) at University of Moratuwa [UoM](http://mrt.ac.lk), Sri Lanka.

I received my Bachelor's degree from UoM in 2020. I completed my thesis on "Designing a Cost-Effective Dry Contact sEMG Sensor System for Controlling a Bionic Hand" with Dr. [Simon Kappel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HTFY3fsAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Thilina Lalitharatne](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0NvOK1kAAAAJ&hl=en)

In addition to my undergraduate studies, I have completed two research internships (in 2017 and 2018) focused on modelling genetic epilepsy based on the high density multi-electrode array (MEA) signals extracted from in-vitro neuronal networks, under the supervision of Prof. [Steve Petrou](https://www.florey.edu.au/science-research/scientist-directory/professor-steven-petrou) and Prof. [Saman Halgamuge](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=9cafqywAAAAJ&hl=en) at The Florey Institute of Neuroscience, University of Melbourne, Australia.

I have also worked with Dr. [Steffen Bollmann](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HmXlj24AAAAJ&hl=en) (Center for Advanced Imaging, University of Queensland, Australia) on exploring the applicability of using fully convolutional networks to unwrap wrapped phase images. 

My primary academic interests lie within **Machine Learning** (statistical machine learning, Geometric Deep Learning, Computer Vision to be more specific), **Signal Processing** and **Computational Neuroscience**. I am fascinated by work that attempts to bridge the gap between the human brain and machines, especially in terms of intelligence.

During my time at UoM, I worked with **Digital System Design, Analog Electronics** and **Robotics** as well.

In my free time, I like playing the piano, exploring restaurants (especially pizzerias!), and watching numerous movies and TV shows involving science fiction, anime, and historical drama!
