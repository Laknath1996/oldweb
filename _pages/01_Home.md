I am currently working as a Temporary Instructor at the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering ([ENTC](ent.mrt.ac.lk)) at University of Moratuwa [UoM](http://mrt.ac.lk), Sri Lanka. 

I received my Bachelor's degree from UoM. I completed my thesis on "Designing a Cost-Effective Dry Contact sEMG Sensor System for Controlling a Bionic Hand" with Dr. [Simon Kappel](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/simon-lind-kappel(ac38d32d-9622-4bf6-9103-1d9225c5322c).html) and Dr. [Thilina Lalitharatne](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0NvOK1kAAAAJ&hl=en)

In addition to my undergraduate studies, I have completed two research internships (in 2017 and 2018) on high density multi-electrode array (MEA) signals of in vitro neuronal networks in epilepsy, under the supervision of Prof. [Steve Petrou](https://www.florey.edu.au/science-research/scientist-directory/professor-steven-petrou) and Prof. [Saman Halgamuge](https://mechanical.eng.unimelb.edu.au/people/saman) at The Florey Institute of Neuroscience, University of Melbourne, Australia.

My academic interests lie within **Machine Learning, Signal Processing, Computational Neuroscience**, **Brain/Muscle-Computer Interfaces** and **Computer Vision**. I am fascinated by work that attempts to bridge the gap between machines and human brain, especially in terms of learning, cognition and movement, and applies computational methods to decode diseases.

I have also worked with **Digital Signal Processing, Digital System Design, Analog Electronics** and **Robotics** during my time at Moratuwa.
