I come from Galle, a town in southern Sri Lanka. Here‘s a video of our beautiful town. It is renowned for its great beaches, sea food and Dutch Fort.

I had my elementary and secondary education from Richmond College. After leaving the school, I co-founded the ‘Richmond to University – R2U’ program with the intention of providing motivation and career guidance for the advanced level students at Richmond. To know more about the program check out our Facebook Page.

At the University of Moratuwa, I currently work as the Chairperson of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Student Branch Chapter. IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS) is the world’s largest international society of biomedical engineers. You can check out our work here.
Also I volunteered for the Research Collaboration Program under SL2College foundation. We intend to build a platform where researchers and undergraduates can share their interests and find potential matches for research projects. You can find more information of this program from here.
I have also helped conduct several astronomy and robotics workshops in some local schools around the island. Passing down the knowledge you acquired to another generation is always a great satisfaction.
In my free time, I play the piano, hang out with my friends or listen to music.
