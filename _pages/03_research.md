<h3>Internship Projects</h3>

* **Developing machine learning and signal processing software to extract interpretable features from high-density multi-electrode array (MEA) signals acquired from in-   vitro neuronal networks, and classify those networks according to the ion-channel mutations they contain. (Jun - Dec 2018) - Research Internship**\\
Advisors : Prof. Steven Petrou, Prof. Saman Halgamuge    
Institution : The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, University of Melbourne, Australia.

* **Developing software to determine the connectivity changes caused to the in-vitro neuronal networks by ion-channel mutations, via modeling the networks as time-varying graphs based on high-density MEA signals. (Jun - Dec 2018)**\\
Advisors : Prof. Steven Petrou, Dr. Andre Peterson
Institution : The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, University of Melbourne, Australia.

* **Developing deep learning algorithms to solve the phase unwrapping problem of MRI (more specifically, QSM) images. (Aug - Nov 2019)**\\
Advisor : Dr. Steffen Bollmann  
Institution : Center for Advanced Imaging, University of Queensland, Australia.
