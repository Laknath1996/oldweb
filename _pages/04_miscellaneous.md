I come from Galle, a town in southern Sri Lanka. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pBoeuQxbfk)‘s a video of our beautiful town. It is renowned for its great beaches, sea food and Dutch Fort.

I had my elementary and secondary education from [Richmond College](http://www.richmondcollege.lk/). After leaving the school, I co-founded the [Richmond to University – R2U](https://www.facebook.com/Rich2Uni/) program with the intention of providing motivation and career guidance for the advanced level students at Richmond.

At the University of Moratuwa, I currently work as the Chairperson of the [IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Student Branch Chapter](https://site.ieee.org/sb-moratuwa-embs/). IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS) is the world’s largest international society of biomedical engineers.

Also I volunteered for the Research Collaboration Program under [SL2College](https://www.facebook.com/sl2college/) foundation. There, we intend to build a platform where Sri Lanknan researchers and undergraduates can share their interests and find potential matches for research projects.

I have also helped conduct several astronomy and robotics workshops in some local schools around the island. Passing down the knowledge you acquired to another generation is always a great satisfaction.
In my free time, I play the piano, hang out with my friends or listen to music.
