### IEEE EMBS Student Branch Chapter at the University of Moratuwa

I served as the chairperson of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS) Student Branch Chapter at the University of Moratuwa (UoM) for the term of 2019/20. Since biomedical engineering (BME) is a relatively new topic in Sri Lanka, our chapter's objective was to create awareness about the field among college students and the general public. To this end, together with my team, I led the organization of many events, including "TechMedImpact Forum 2017" (Sri Lanka's first-ever BME forum), "Brainstorm" 2018 and 2019 (Sri Lanka's premier interdisciplinary BME design competition), BME Seminar series (2016 - Present), exhibitions, and conference workshops. Our work in the term 2019/20 was recognized by IEEE EMB Society (The world's largest professional BME community) by presenting the Regional (Asia-Pacific) **Best Student Chapter Award**. Also, IEEE presented us with the **Darrel Chong Silver Award** for organizing Brainstorm 2019. I am humbled by the opportunity I got through the chapter to uplift BME's status in my country while I was still an undergraduate. Here're some of the moments from my days at the IEEE EMBS Student Chapter at UoM.

### Richmond to University Foundation

I co-founded "R2U" (Richmond to University), a not-for-profit organization aimed at motivating and providing career guidance advice to the high school students of Richmond College, Sri Lanka, in 2018. Since then, we have organized many workshops and lectures at the school and have received positive feedback from the participants. In schools like Richmond, located outside of the country's capital, the students get less exposure to higher studies, careers, and essential skills. Through our organization, we were able to address this issue and direct the students to make informed decisions about their future.

### Astronomical Observation Sessions  

From 2016 to 2019, I, together with my colleagues, had the opportunity to organize several recreational astronomy sessions in some rural areas of Sri Lanka. These sessions typically commenced with a brief introduction about telescopes and celestial bodies that we can observe in the night sky. Then we would set up our telescopes and let the session participants, often comprised of local families, observe the night sky's mesmerizing objects such as the moon, planets, satellites, and nebulae. I always admired star-gazing, and therefore, sharing my passion with these local communities was an enriching experience. Among the sessions, my team and I organized, we had the most moving experience at a session we conducted for a group of autistic children and their parents.

### Robotics workshops for school girls

In Sri Lanka, women are often underrepresented in STEM fields like robotics. To alleviate this problem, a few colleagues and I organized several workshops to promote robotics among young schoolgirls in the country. In these workshops, we taught the children about simple robotics, programming, and electronics principles. Our effort received positive feedback from the community, and in the following years, we were happy to see that some of the children we taught in these workshops were attending major robotics competitions in the country.

### Teaching Mathematics for underprivileged schools

In 2016, I partnered with the University Leo Club to teach mathematics to a group of students from a rural school in my home district. These children were very talented, but their potential remained unnoticed because of the lack of proper mentorship. Through this tutoring, we covered a wide range of mathematical topics for them to prepare well for their ordinary level exams.
